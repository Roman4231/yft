        1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart.\n
        2. Place your hands behind your head so your thumbs are behind your ears.\n
        3. Don’t lace your fingers together.\n
        4. Hold your elbows out to the sides but rounded slightly in.\n
        5. Tilt your chin slightly, leaving a few inches of space between your chin and your chest.\n
        6. Gently pull your abdominals inward.\n
        7. Curl up and forward so that your head, neck, and shoulder blades lift off the floor.\n
        8. Hold for a moment at the top of the movement and then lower slowly back down.
    </string>
    <string name="info_buttKicks">
        1. Start standing tall and bring one heel off the floor towards your glutes, the opposite hand comes up towards you shoulder like running arms, then switch to the other side.\n
        2. This exercise is working your hamstrings so you should feel this in the glutes and the back of the legs as you pull the heel in.
    </string>
    <string name="info_jumpingJacks">
        1. Stand up straight. As simple as standing up straight sounds, there is a technique to it. Relax your shoulders back and down along your spine.
        Keep the natural curve of your neck by relaxing your jaw too.
        Hold the top of your head up and directly between the tops of your shoulders. Keep your hips over your heels and relax your pelvis. \n
        2. Hold your arms at your sides and feet shoulder width. From an upright, standing position widen your stance so that your feet are below your shoulders.
        Keep your arms beside your body and relaxed.\n
        3. Jump and extend your arms overhead. With your feet shoulder width apart, slightly bend your knees so you can hop.
        As you hop, or jump just a few inches off the ground, lift your arms overhead until your hands are about shoulder width apart.\n
        4. Extend your legs. As you jump, open your legs wider than shoulder width as you lift your arms overhead.
        Give or take some space depending on your height and leave a wide amount of space between your feet. \n
        5. Land in the starting position. After jumping in the air, gently land in the first position with arms at your sides and feet shoulder width apart.
    </string>
    <string name="info_squats">
        1. Stand with your head facing forward and your chest held up and out.\n
        2. Place your feet shoulder-width apart or slightly wider. Extend your hands straight out in front of you to help keep your balance. You can also bend the elbows or clasp the fingers.\n
        3. Sit back and down like you\'re sitting into an imaginary chair. Keep your head facing forward as your upper body bends forward a bit. Rather than allowing your back to round,
        let your lower back arch slightly as you descend.\n
        4. Lower down so your thighs are as parallel to the floor as possible, with your knees over your ankles. Press your weight back into your heels.\n
        5. Keep your body tight, and push through your heels to bring yourself back to the starting position.
    </string>
    <string name="info_squatsWithDumbbell">
        1. Stand up straight while holding a dumbbell on each hand (palms facing the side of your legs).\n
        2. Position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out.
        Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position.
        Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development;
        however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section.\n
        3. Begin to slowly lower your torso by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until your thighs are parallel to the floor.
        Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.
        If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n
        4. Begin to raise your torso as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\n
        5. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
    </string>
    <string name="info_squatSideKick">
        1. Start in a squat position with your hips back and your feet shoulder width apart.\n
        2. As you stand up switch your weight to the right leg and lift your left leg to a side.\n
        3. Return to the squat position and repeat with the right leg.
    </string>
    <string name="info_lunges">
        1. Keep your upper body straight, with your shoulders back and relaxed and chin up (pick a point to stare at in front of you so you don\'t keep looking down).
        Always engage your core.\n
        2. Step forward with one leg, lowering your hips until both knees are bent at about a 90-degree angle.
        Make sure your front knee is directly above your ankle, not pushed out too far, and make sure your other knee doesn\'t touch the floor.
        Keep the weight in your heels as you push back up to the starting position.
    </string>
    <string name="info_bridging">
        1. Lie down on your back. It\'s recommended that you use a yoga mat for this exercise, but any padded floor will do.
        You don\'t want to hurt yourself by doing the bridge on a hard surface. As you lie down, make sure to keep your knees bent and hip distance apart,
        and the soles of your feet planted firmly on the floor. Walk your heels back as close to your buttocks as possible.
        If it is easier, scoot your buttocks toward your heels. You\'ll need to use the strength of your feet and your glutes to help you lift up.\n
        2. Keep your arms at your sides. You can lie with your elbows turned inward and your palms up, just a few inches away from your hips to help stabilize your core.
        Draw your shoulder blades together to pull your shoulders back toward the floor.
        Alternately, you can also place your hands and your elbows down. This can offer you a bit more support and will protect your wrists as you lift up.\n
        3. Lift your hips toward the ceiling. As you do this, make sure to tilt your pelvis and to pull your belly button toward your spine to engage your transverse abdomens.
        Press your feet into the floor and lift your hips to the ceiling as high as is comfortable.
        Think of it as lifting your hips to the sky or the ceiling. As you lift, you should squeeze your buttocks to make them more firm, but not harden them too much.\n
        4. Keep your knees and thighs parallel. Do not let them splay out to the side or you can injure your knees and your back. Keep your shoulders on the floor to protect your neck.
        Remember to pull your shoulders into the mat as you lift up.\n
        5. Hold the pose for 5 full breaths and release back to the start position. Make sure to relax your rib cage as you do this.
        Gently lower yourself down, doing it slowly so you don\'t collapse onto your back and neck. Slide your feet down a bit until you are comfortably on the floor.\n
        6. Perform the exercise in reps of 10 lifts. You can repeat this three times to get the benefit of a good workout.

        1. Lie on your back with your arms out by your sides to aid balance, with both your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.\n
        2. Keeping your abdominal and glut muscles contracted throughout the movement raise both heels up off the floor,
        holding in this upper phase for 2 – 5 seconds, prior to smoothly returning back down to the floor and repeating.
    </string>
    <string name="info_shoulderFly">
        1. Performing flyes correctly can help you to develop the shoulders while reducing your chances of sustaining an injury. \n
        2. Choose dumbbell weights that allow you to fatigue between eight and 12 repetitions, which means that you would not be able to perform one more rep with proper form. \n
        3. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand with an overhand grip. \n
        4. Lean your torso forward by approximately 20 to 30 degrees with the dumbbells directly under your chest. \n
        5. Raise your arms in a semi-circle motion out to the side until the upper arm is parallel to the floor. Hold the contraction for one count and then return to starting position.
    </string>
    <string name="info_dumbbellOneArmTricepsExtension">
        1. Grab a dumbbell and either sit on a military press bench or a utility bench that has a back support on it as you place the dumbbells upright on top of your thighs or stand up straight.\n
        2. Clean the dumbbell up to bring it to shoulder height and then extend the arm over your head so that the whole arm is perpendicular to the floor and next to your head.
        The dumbbell should be on top of you. The other hand can be kept fully extended to the side, by the waist, supporting the upper arm that has the dumbbell or grabbing a fixed surface.\n
        3. Rotate the wrist so that the palm of your hand is facing forward and the pinkie is facing the ceiling. This will be your starting position.\n
        4. Slowly lower the dumbbell behind your head as you hold the upper arm stationary. Inhale as you perform this movement and pause when your triceps are fully stretched.\n
        5. Return to the starting position by flexing your triceps as you breathe out. Tip: It is imperative that only the forearm moves. The upper arm should remain at all times stationary next to your head.\n
        6. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and switch arms.
    </string>
    <string name="info_dumbbellAlternateBicepCurl">
        1. Stand (torso upright) with a dumbbell in each hand held at arms length. The elbows should be close to the torso and the palms of your hand should be facing your thighs.\n
        2. While holding the upper arm stationary, curl the right weight as you rotate the palm of the hands until they are facing forward.
        At this point continue contracting the biceps as you breathe out until your biceps is fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.
        Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps. Tip: Only the forearms should move.\n
        3. Slowly begin to bring the dumbbell back to the starting position as your breathe in.
        Tip: Remember to twist the palms back to the starting position (facing your thighs) as you come down.\n
        4. Repeat the movement with the left hand. This equals one repetition.\n
        5. Continue alternating in this manner for the recommended amount of repetitions.
    </string>
    <string name="info_tricepsBenchDips">
        1. For this exercise you will need to place a bench behind your back. With the bench perpendicular to your body,
        and while looking away from it, hold on to the bench on its edge with the hands fully extended, separated at shoulder width.
        The legs will be extended forward, bent at the waist and perpendicular to your torso. This will be your starting position.\n
        2. Slowly lower your body as you inhale by bending at the elbows until you lower yourself far enough to where there is an angle slightly smaller
        than 90 degrees between the upper arm and the forearm.
        Tip: Keep the elbows as close as possible throughout the movement. Forearms should always be pointing down.\n
        3. Using your triceps to bring your torso up again, lift yourself back to the starting position.\n
        4. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
    </string>
    <string name="info_plank">
        1. Plant the hands directly under the shoulders (slightly wider than shoulder-width apart) like you’re about to do a push-up.\n
        2. Ground the toes into the floor and squeeze the glutes to stabilize the body. Your legs should be working in the move too; careful not to lock or hyperextend your knees.\n
        3. Neutralize the neck and spine by looking at a spot on the floor about a foot beyond the hands. Your head should be in line with your back.\n
        4. Hold the position for 20 seconds. As you get more comfortable with the move, hold your plank for as long as possible without compromising form or breath.
    </string>
    <string name="info_pushUps">
        1. With your arms straight, butt clenched, and abs braced, steadily lower yourself until your elbows are at a 90 degree angle or smaller. Depending on your level of experience, age, and flexibility,
        90 degrees might be the lowest you’re able to go. Personally, I like to go down until my chest (not my face), hits the floor.  That way, I know I’m going the same distance each and every time.\n
        2. Try not to let your elbows go flying way out with each repetition. Keep them relatively close to your body, and keep note of when they start to fly out when you get tired.\n
        3. Once your chest touches the floor (or your arms go down to a 90 degree angle), pause slightly and then explode back up until you’re back in the same position.

        If lying down, your hands should be positioned slightly in front of your hips. Raise your hips so they point sharply to the ceiling.\n
        2. Lower your chest to the ground by bending your elbows while keeping your legs straight.\n
        3. Slide your chest forward and then up as you lower your hips to the ground.
        This movement should create a scooping arc with your upper body and end with your head pointed up to the ceiling.\n
        4. Lift up your hips and shift them back to the starting position to complete your first Hindu pushup repetition. Try to work up to 10 reps in total at the beginning.

        3. Explosively press yourself up so that your hands leave the floor. Land with your arms extended and reset your body back to starting position.
